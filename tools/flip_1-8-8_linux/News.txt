  ------------------------
* The bootloader version 1.1.1 loaded into the following devices :
  T89C51RB2 & T89C51RC2
  allows writing the BSB byte after the device has been set to 
  security level 1.

* The bootloader version 1.2.4 loaded into the T89C51RD2 device
  forbids the blank check operation after the device has been set
  to level 2. The blank check operation should be allowed, whatever
  the security level is.

* For the On-Line Help to work properly, FLIP must be
  launched from the directory which houses the flip.exe
  file.
