ATMEL


Requirements
------------

This program runs on Windows 98/Me/NT/2000/XP and Linux platforms.


Windows Installation
--------------------

- Copy the Flip_<version>.zip file to an empty temporary directory.
- Uncompress the zip file so that you get a Flip_<version> directory.
- Open the Flip_<version> directory and run the Setup file.
- Follow the installation program instructions.

Linux Installation
------------------

- Uncompress the archive file:
  tar xvzf flip_<version>_linux.tgz

Flip partly relies on Tcl/Tk libraries; your Linux release may contain
outdated versions of these libraries. In this package, we provide
the Tcl/Tk libraries on which Flip has been built.

In order to load the Tcl/Tk libraries provided by Atmel (libtcl8.3.so and 
libtk8.3.so) you should edit (as root) the "/etc/ld.so.conf" file and add 
the full path of these libraries. Execute the "ldconfig" command afterwards.

Post Installation Instructions
------------------------------

CAN

After FLIP installation completion, CAN users must install their
CAN dongle software and reboot their PC platform.

The VECTOR CANpari dongle requires the user's PATH variable 
to be updated so that it contains the path to the vccand32.dll file.

Before using the PEAK PCAN dongle, you must launch the PEAK dll
installation program named pcandrv.exe and located in the 
<your_HDD>:\Program Files\ATMEL\FLIP x.y.z


USB

After FLIP installation completion, USB users must execute
Start > Programs > Atmel > FLIP > Install USB Drivers

FLIP-USB can be used on Windows 98/Me/2000/XP platforms only.
