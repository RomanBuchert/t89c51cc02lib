Version 1.8.8; May-16-2003
==========================

- New supported devices: AT89C51RD2, AT89C51ED2 and AT89C51ID2.

- USB 2.0 supported through Jungo's WinDriver 5.2.2 version.

- RM CANview interface connection problem fixed; the error message was:
  "can't read deviceArray(bootloaderId)".

- Vector CANpari interface node connect problem fixed.

- Possible CUSTOM memory selection with the T89C51AC2 device if the bootloader
  version >= 1.5

- 1200 bps added to the RS232 baudrate selection list.


Version 1.8.2; October-04-2002
==============================

- New supported devices: AT89C5131, AT89C5132
  AT89C51RB2, AT89C51RC2 and AT89C51IC2.

- New USB drivers from Jungo supporting Windows 2000 SP3.

- Start Application command bug fixed on the T8XC5121 device.

- Inhanced troubleshooting and CAN interfaces information in the User's Manual.

- New Buffer commands: Search, Copy and Move data.

- Possible serialization of parts through the configuration file.


Version 1.7.1; July-03-2002
===========================

- Supports the AT89C5131, T89C5115 and T89C51IC2 devices.

- Update the buffer checksum on device reading completion.

- P1/P3/P4 config bytes settings are made possible for the
  CC02 device if the bootloader version > 1.1.

- Add Start Application capability to the config file.

- After a device read, the buffer is considered to be modified. Therefore
  if we launch a device program, we don't prompt the user any more for
  continuing to program. A buffer reset cancels this.

- If the connection times out, the GUI must remain disabled. Fixed.

- FLIP exited when there was no available serial port, even though the user
  intended to perform ISP through USB. Fixed.
